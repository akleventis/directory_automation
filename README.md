# Semester File System Setup 

Are you tired of laying out a whole file system setup each semester? I know I am...which is why I made this quick application that creates it for you!

## Prerequisite

Make sure python is installed on your system

```bash
> python3 --version
Python 3.8.3
```
If python isn't installed, check out this [link](https://realpython.com/installing-python/) to get started

## Run App in Terminal
1. Clone this repo
2. Navigate to the folder where you have the ".py" file
```bash
> alexleventis@mac DirectoryAutomation % 
```
3. Run application
```bash
> alexleventis@mac Python3 automate.py % 
```
4. Follow the prompts on screen and you'll be ready to tackle the new semester pain free!
